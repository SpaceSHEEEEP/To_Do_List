I wrote a simple to-do list programme. I would like to make many more small c++ projects so that I can practice and gain more confidence in my programming so this is hopefully the fist out of many tiny personal projects. 

Stuff that I think could be added:
- tag feature
- ability to prioritise tasks
- deadlines for tasks
- better GUI (maybe i can learn Qt)

Since this was intended to be a small project, I probably won't implement new features to this in the foreseeable future. 

I am always interested in optimising my code as I think writing optimised code is an art form so do reach out to me if you can teach me where my code can be improved. I am always happy to receive free advice!! :D
